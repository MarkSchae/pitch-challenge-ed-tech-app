## Language learning tool for foundation phase

A gamified approach to early literacy in South Africa

## Problem

South Africa faces a serious literacy challenge. Many children struggle to read and comprehend text at the foundation phase.

Research shows that one key reason is that learners are often taught to read in a second language before building the fundamentals in reading and comprehension in their home language.

Children who first learn to read in their mother tongue:

- Build stronger comprehension, confidence, and long-term learning skills.

- Transfer these skills to other languages more easily.

However, accessible, interactive learning tools in local languages are rare, especially those that are personalized, data-driven, research-informed, and technology-powered.

## Proposed Solution

Language Learning Adventure is a simple, interactive web-based learning game that helps children connect letter sounds and symbols, starting with IsiXhosa.

The application:

- Teaches learners to recognize and connect letter sounds.

- Provides clear, direct instructions with engaging visual and audio feedback.

- Encourages correct answers with praise and gently motivates retries after mistakes.

- Makes focused learning feel like play.

## Game Flow

The learner presses Start.

A brief countdown builds anticipation.

Instructions are played, explaining the learning loop:

Listen carefully.

Look at the letter on screen.

Choose the letter that makes the sound you hear.

Hear the letter sound repeated three times (play rate slows after three presses).

Receive praise for correct answers and encouragement for retries.

## Practical Impact

This MVP focuses on connection through technology. Connecting learners to education tools in their home language.

With future expansion to additional South African languages, this project could support a broader effort to make foundational literacy:

- Accessible

- Playful

- Personal

## Future Improvements

Storing and analyzing learner progress data.

A more engaging and visually appealing UI.

Additional game levels and varied learning loops.

Mobile version.

Cleaner, modular code design (potential React refactor).

Improved documentation, including the research behind design choices.

## Technical Overview

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript

Game Logic: Custom DOM manipulation and animation (explosions, transitions, countdowns)

Event-driven JavaScript

Future Backend: Node.js or Django (for data storage and learner analytics)

## Collaboration and Research Context

This project was developed in collaboration with a professional linguist, ensuring that the design and learning flow are informed by current linguistic research and educational theory.
