    Research shows that learning to read in your home language first is better 
    There is currently a lack of tools specifically designed for learners who do not speak English as their first language 

How 
    Fun and engaging game like application that uses phonics (sounds of words) awareness
    App creates a environment for learners to easily access phonics learning 

Technologies
