Creating a Ed Tech web app for a pitch challenge themed connections.

Connecting learners to language education through technology.


Main 'problem' to solve 
    Aiding foundation phase learners to learn how to read in their native language(Xhosa)

Why
    Reading is an essetial skill
    Learners in South Africa has a learning crisis when it comes to reading and comprehension
    Research shows that learning to read in your home language first is better 
    There is currently a lack of tools specifically designed for learners who do not speak English as their first language 

How 
    Fun and engaging game like application that uses phonics (sounds of words) awareness
    App creates a environment for learners to easily access phonics learning 

Technologies
    Tailwind
    Javascript
    Html 

Initial workflow: (Function => Styling => Scalability => Maintainability => Improvements => Refactoring)
    Landing page and navigation to next page (button)
    Explain page - Quick and child friendly explaination of how the game works and the current level/sound/letter
        - Include a picture of the letter as well as three repetitions of the letter sound
    Interaction/Game page - user can push a button to listen to the sound and pick a answer

Future Improvements:
    TBC 

Initial Landing page:
    For now is just a button to be pressed
    Onclick function to display the explain page elements  
    Event listener can be on the whole element and use targetclosest to target all elements including the main 
    SPA design 
    Load the explain page elements 

Initial Explain page:
    Load Onclick of button on Landing page
    Visible count-down to indicate the event
        Div containing numbers
        Js function to start the numbers at 3 and count backwards updating the onscreen number 
        Once number reaches zero, load the sound and letter elements  
    Voice (sound) playing the explaination and example of the letter sound
        Sound playing element 
        Sound stored internally for now 
        No controls needed for the user, maybe a button to play again
        Sound is of a 'teacher' basically explaining how the game works 
    Visible letter (current letter)
        Nice animated appreance of the current level letter whilst the 'teacher' explains the game 
        Count-down function to count down to the loading of the game elements (helper function)
        Display the game elements when the timer is zero 

Initial Game page (loop):
    Loaded when timer reaches zero 
    Display the letter 
    Button element within a div for design choices
    Button functionality - onclick must play the sound of the letter (how to properly say the sound of the letter)
    Load letter options on button first click
    Each option when clicked also plays the sound again 
    Option is highlighted onclick 
    A submit button is highlighted when an option is clicked 
    When submit button is clicked load a message to indicate a In/Correct answer 



Left to do:
    Only dragon sprite on play page
    Fix the option letters on game page
    The resonse to winning must have confeite and cannons
    The dragon must be on the left hand side or maybe only appears when choosing and appears at a certian distance so it looks like its hitting the letter 
    Presentation and slideshow 
    Insert the new audio
