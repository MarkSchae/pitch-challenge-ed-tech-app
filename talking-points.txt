Problem (Collaborating with a professional lingguist in the industry)
    > South Africa faces a serious literacy challenge.
    > Many children struggle to read and comprehend text at the foundation phase
        - Research suggests (cite Research) that one reason is that learners are often taught to read in a second language before learning reading and comprehension in thier home language.
    > Research shows that children who first learn to read in their 'mother-tongue' 
        - build stronger comprehension, confidence, and long-term learning skills.
        - transfer these skills to other languages more easily.
    > But thereâ€™s a gap: accessible, interactive learning tools in local languages are rare
        - especially ones that are research/data/tech driven.

Proposed solution (aiding towards a long term solution)

> Providing learners with a easy to use and fun way to connect to more language education through tech.
> It is a simple learning game that helps children 
    - learn to recognize and connect letter sounds 
    - starting with IsiXhosa. (Based on current research?)
> The app is designed to be direct to learner
    - giving clear instructions, playing letter sounds, and guiding them through each step.
> Positive feedback is given for correct answers
    - encouraging gentle retries when the learner makes a mistake
    - all designed to make focused learning feel like play.

Demo: (make a youtube vid with a slideshow presentation and a live app demo)

> The learner starts by pressing the play button. (improvement to UI will change this)
> A short countdown builds excitement. (This is just a placeholder for better navigation)
> Instructions are played explaining the game loop:
    - Listen carefully
    - Look at the letter on the screen
    - Choose the letter that makes the letter sound
    - Letter sound 
    - After three presses of the letter sound, the play-rate is reduced
    - Praise if the letter chose is correct
    - Gentle encouraging if the chose is incorrect 


Practical implications

> This MVP is about connection through technology
    - connecting learners to education in their home language, to confidence, and to opportunity.
> With expansion to other South African languages, this tool can become part of a larger mission:
    - making foundational literacy accessible, playful, and personal.
> Learners across the country spending just a few extra minutes a day 
    - improving reading and comprehension skills in their own language, on any device.
> The ultimate goal is connection and empowerment through data/research driven tech.

Maybe the goal is actually to provide the research with an effective intervention platform?

Future Improvements

> Storing and analysis of data (results data for each learner). 
> UI more entertaining.
> More levels of the game.
> Different types of game loops surrounding the core of the learning objectives
> Mobile version of the app.
> Cleaner code design.
    - Might refactor to React.
    - Seperation of code responsibility (modular).
    - Documentation (maybe include the research behind the teaching choices).
